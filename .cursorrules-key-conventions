# Key Conventions and Best Practices

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

## Key Conventions
1. Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment.
2. Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
3. Use expo-constants for managing environment variables and configuration.
4. Use expo-permissions to handle device permissions gracefully.
5. Implement expo-updates for over-the-air (OTA) updates.
6. Follow Expo's best practices for app deployment and publishing: https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/
7. Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms.

## API Documentation
- Use Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

Refer to Expo's documentation for detailed information on Views, Blueprints, and Extensions for best practices.
