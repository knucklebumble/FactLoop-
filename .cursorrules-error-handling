# Error Handling and Validation Rules

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

## Error Handling and Validation
- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or a similar service.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
- Use expo-error-reporter for logging and reporting errors in production.
