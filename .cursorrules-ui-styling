# UI and Styling Rules

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

## UI and Styling
- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments.
- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS for component styling.
- Implement dark mode support using Expo's useColorScheme.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.

## Safe Area Management
- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.
