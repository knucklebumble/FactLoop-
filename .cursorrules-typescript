# TypeScript Rules

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.
