## ðŸ“± User Experience

### Flow Structure
1. **Welcome Screen** - Introduction with rocket emoji
2. **Connection Screen** - Features overview with star emoji  
3. **Get Started Screen** - Call to action with sparkle emoji

### Interaction Patterns
- **Skip button** in top-right corner on all screens
- **Previous button** appears from second screen onwards
- **Next/Get Started button** changes text on final screen
- **Automatic persistence** of onboarding completion

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- âœ… **Persistent onboarding state** - Users only see it once
- âœ… **Beautiful animations** and smooth transitions
- âœ… **Responsive design** for all screen sizes

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The onboarding screen automatically appears on first app launch. Once completed, users will see the main app content. To reset and see the onboarding again during development, clear the app's AsyncStorage or reinstall the app.

### Development Reset
To reset onboarding status for testing:
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('onboarding_completed');
```

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- Add swipe gestures for navigation
- Include interactive elements or mini-tutorials
- Add more sophisticated animations
- Implement analytics tracking
- Add customizable onboarding content from API
- Support for video backgrounds or lottie animations
