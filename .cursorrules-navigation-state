# Navigation and State Management Rules

You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.

## Navigation
- Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
- Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
- Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.

## State Management
- Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state.
- Leverage react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls.
- For complex state management, consider using Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
- Handle URL search parameters using libraries like expo-linking.
